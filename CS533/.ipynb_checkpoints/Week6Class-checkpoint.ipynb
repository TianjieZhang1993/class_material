The [variable list](https://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs/acs5/variables.html) describes these variables, and the ones of interest are all reported as **estimated population counts**.  That means variable `B06009_003E` is an estimate, based on the sample, of the number of people in a geographic region whose highest educational attainment is a high school degree.\n",
