    "# Week 5 Application Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the starting notebook for the Week 5 application exercise.  It is intended to demonstrate several things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The use of simulation as a tool for understanding statistical methods\n",
    "- Performing hypothesis tests\n",
    "- The difference between paired and two-sample tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the notebook file and `.py` file into the same folder to start work on the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please treat the experiment as a black box and infer its behavior using the statistical techniques we have learned in class.  After class, I invite you to look at its source code and see how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of this is to identify whether “fabulators” under condition A have higher (or lower) nonsense production than under condition B.  The code will describe an experimental design, and allow you to “run” the experiment to draw samples."
